# Obstacles-Avoiding-Robot-Project

I implemented this project individually during robotics course, it is a differential wheeled robot able to avoid any obstacle facing it while following a track drawn on the ground by detecting a dark line on a white surface, programmed using Arduino IDE and tested on hardware model and Arduino kit.
